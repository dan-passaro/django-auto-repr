# django-auto-repr

This is a tiny project to quickly give Django models a usable `repr()`.  To use
it, have your models inherit from `django_auto_repr.AutoRepr`, e.g.:

    class Product(AutoRepr, models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
        qty = models.IntegerField()

With this definition, your REPL sesssions will look like this:

    >>> Product.objects.first()
    Product(id=1, name='My Product', qty=3)

In addition to being more readable, this representation has the additional
benefit, shared by Python standard library classes like Decimal and OrderedDict,
that it can be copied and pasted back into the REPL to construct an equivalent
object.
